A friend asked me if it could read an article, summarize it, and answer some questions, like a research assistant. At that time, ChatGPT had no tools to explore websites, but I was unaware of this. So, I gave it the article’s link. It responded with an abstract of the article. Since the article was a medical research paper, and I had no medical background, I was amazed by the result and eagerly shared my enthusiasm with my friend. However, when he reviewed the abstract, he noticed it had almost nothing to do with the article.Then, I realized what had happened. As you might guess, ChatGPT had taken the URL, which included the article’s title, and “made up” an abstract. This “making up” event is what we call a hallucination, a term popularized by Andrej Karpathy in 2015 in the context of RNNs and extensively used nowadays for large language models (LLMs).What are LLM hallucinations?LLMs like GPT4o, Llama 3.1, Claude 3.5, or Gemini Pro 1.5 have made a huge jump in quality compared to the first of its class, GPT 3.5. However, they are all based on the same decoder-only transformer architecture, with the sole goal of predicting the next token based on a sequence of given or already predicted tokens. This is called causal language modeling. Relying on this goal task and looping (pre-training) over a gigantic dataset of text (15T tokens for Llama 3.1) trying to predict each one of its tokens is how an LLM acquires its ability to understand natural language.There is a whole field of study on how LLMs select the following token for a sequence. In the following, we’ll exclusively talk about LLMs with greedy decoding, which means choosing the most probable token for the next token prediction. Given that, talking about hallucinations is hard because, in some sense, all an LLM does is hallucinate tokens.                Fine-Tuning Llama 3 with LoRA: Step-by-Step Guide            LLM hallucinations become a problem in LLM-based applicationsMost of the time, if you use an LLM, you probably won’t use a base LLM but an LLM-based assistant whose goal is to help with your requests and reliably answer your questions. Ultimately, the student has been trained (post-training) to follow your instructions. Here’s when hallucinations become an undesirable bug.In short, hallucinations occur when a user instruction (prompt) leads the LLM to predict tokens that are not aligned with the expected answer or ground truth. These hallucinations mainly happen either because the correct token was not available or because the LLM failed to retrieve it.Before we dive into this further, I’d like to stress that when thinking about LLM hallucinations, it’s important to keep in mind the difference between a base LLM and an LLM-based assistant. When we talk about LLM hallucinations as a problematic phenomenon, it’s in the context of an LLM-based assistant or system.Where in the transformer architecture are hallucinations generated?The statement “all an LLM does is hallucinate tokens” conceals a lot of meaning. To uncover this, let’s walk through the transformer architecture to understand how tokens are generated during inference and where hallucinations may be happening.Hallucinations can occur throughout the process to predict the next token in a sequence of tokens:What causes LLMs to hallucinate?While there are many origins of hallucinations within an LLM’s architecture, we can simplify and categorize the root causes into four main origins of hallucinations:Lack of or scarce data during trainingAs a rule of thumb, an LLM cannot give you any info that was not clearly shown during training. Trying to do so is one of the fastest ways to get a hallucination.How an LLM actually learns factual knowledge is not yet fully understood, and a lot of research is ongoing. But we do know that for an LLM to learn some knowledge, it is not enough to show it some information once. In fact, it benefits from being exposed to a piece of knowledge from diverse sources and perspectives, avoiding duplicated data, and maximizing the LLM opportunities to link it with other close knowledge (like a field of study). This is why scarce knowledge, commonly known as “long-tail knowledge,” usually shows high hallucination rates.There’s also certain knowledge that an LLM could not have possibly seen during training:                Zero-Shot and Few-Shot Learning With LLMs            Lack of alignmentAnother rule of thumb is that an LLM is just trying to follow your instructions and answer with the most probable response it has. But what happens if an LLM doesn’t know how to follow instructions properly? That is due to a lack of alignment.Alignment is the process of teaching an LLM how to follow instructions and respond helpfully, safely, and reliably to match our human expectations. This process happens during the post-training stage, which includes different fine-tuning methods.Imagine using an LLM-based meal assistant. You ask for a nutritious and tasty breakfast suitable for someone with celiac disease. The assistant recommends salmon, avocado, and toast. Why? The model likely knows that toast contains gluten, but when asked for a breakfast suggestion, it failed to ensure that all items met the dietary requirements.Instead, it defaulted to the most probable and common pairing with salmon and avocado, which happened to be a toast. This is an example of a hallucination caused by misalignment. The assistant’s response didn’t meet the requirements for a celiac-friendly menu, not because the LLM didn’t understand what celiac disease is but because it failed to accurately follow the instructions provided.Although the example may seem simplistic, and modern LLMs have largely addressed these issues, similar mistakes can still be observed with smaller or older language models.Poor attention performanceAttention is the process of modeling the interaction between input tokens via the dot product of Query and Key matrices, generating an attention matrix, which is then multiplied with a Value matrix to get the attention output. This operation represents a mathematical way of expressing a lookup of knowledge related to the input tokens, weighing it, and then responding to the request based on it.Poor attention performance means not properly attending to all relevant parts of the prompt and thus not having available the information needed to respond appropriately. Attention performance is an inherent property of LLMs fundamentally determined by architecture and hyperparameter choice. Nevertheless, it seems like a combination of fine-tuning and some tweaks on the positional embedding brings huge improvements in attention performance.Typical poor attention-based hallucinations are those when, after a relatively long conversation, the model is unable to remember a certain date you mentioned or your name or even forgets the instructions given at the very beginning. We can assess this using the “needle in a haystack” evaluation, which assesses whether an LLM can accurately retrieve the fact across varying context lengths.TokenizerThe tokenizer is a core part of the LLMs due to its singular functionality. It’s the single component in the transformer architecture, which is at the same time the root cause of hallucinations and where hallucinations are generated.The tokenizer is the component where input text is chunked into little pieces of characters represented by a numeric ID, the tokens. Tokenizers learn the correspondences between word chunks and tokens separately from the LLM training. Hence, it is the only component that is not necessarily trained with the same dataset as the transformer.This can lead to words being interpreted with a totally different meaning. In extreme cases, certain tokens can completely break an LLM. One of the first widely discussed examples was the SolidGoldMagikarp token, which GPT-3 internally understood as the verb “distribute,” resulting in weird conversation completions.Is it possible to detect hallucinations?When it comes to detecting hallucinations, what you actually want to do is evaluate if the LLM responds reliably and truthfully. We can classify evaluations based on whether the ground truth (reference) is available or not.Reference-based evaluationsComparing ground truth against LLM-generated answers is based on the same principles of classic machine learning model evaluation. However, unlike other models, language predictions cannot be compared word by word. Instead, semantic and fact-based metrics must be used. Here are some of the main ones:                LLM Evaluation For Text Summarization            Reference-free evaluationsWhen there is no ground truth, evaluation methods may be separated based on whether the LLM response is generated from a given context (i.e., RAG-like frameworks) or not:                LLM Observability: Fundamentals, Practices, and Tools            How to reduce hallucinations in LLMs?Hallucinations have been one of the main obstacles to the adoption of LLM assistants in enterprises. LLMs are persuasive to the point of fooling PhDs in their own field. The potential harm to non-expert users is high when talking, for example, about health. So, preventing them is one of the main focuses for different stakeholders:Hence, an overwhelming amount of new hallucination-prevention methods are constantly being released. (If you’re curious, try searching the recent posts on X talking about “hallucination mitigation” or the latest papers on Google Scholar talking about “LLM hallucination.” By the way, this is a good way to stay updated.)Broadly speaking, we can reduce hallucinations in LLMs by filtering responses, prompt engineering, achieving better alignment, and improving the training data. To navigate the space, we can use a simple taxonomy to organize current and upcoming methods. Hallucinations can be prevented at different steps of the process an LLM uses to generate an output, and we can use this as the foundation for our categorization.After the responseCorrecting a hallucination after the LLM output has been generated is still beneficial, as it prevents the user from seeing the incorrect information. This approach can effectively transform correction into prevention by ensuring that the erroneous response never reaches the user. The process can be broken down into the following steps:This method is part of multi-step reasoning strategies, which are increasingly important in handling complex problems. These strategies, often referred to as “agents,” are gaining popularity. One well-known agent pattern is reflection. By identifying hallucinations early, you can address and correct them before they impact the user.During the response (in context)Since the LLM will directly respond to the user’s request, we can inject information before starting the generation to condition the model’s response. Here are the most relevant strategies to condition response:A good example of the “Chain of Thoughts” approach is the Anthropic’s Claude using <antthinking> to give itself space to reflect and the addition of “Let’s think step by step” at the end of any prompt.\\xa0As an alternative to retrieving information, if an LLM context window is long enough, any document or data source could be directly added to the prompt, leveraging in-context learning. This would be a brute-force approach, and while costly, it could be effective when reasoning over an entire knowledge base instead of just some retrieved parts.Post-training or alignmentIt is hypothesized that an LLM instructed not only to respond and follow instructions but also to take time to reason and reflect on a problem could largely mitigate the hallucination issue—either by providing the correct answer or by stating that it does not know how to answer.Furthermore, you can teach a model to use external tools during the reasoning process,\\xa0 like getting information from a search engine. There are a lot of different fine-tuning techniques being tested to achieve this. Some LLMs already working with this reasoning strategy are Matt Shumer’s Reflection-LLama-3.1-70b and OpenAI’s O1 family models.Pre-trainingIncreasing the pre-training dataset or introducing new knowledge directly leads to broader knowledge coverage and fewer hallucinations, especially regarding facts and recent events. Additionally, better data processing and curation enhance LLM learning. Unfortunately, pre-training requires vast computational resources, mainly GPUs, which are only accessible to large companies and frontier AI labs. Despite that, if the problem is big enough, pre-training may still be a viable solution, as the OpenAI and Harvey case showed.Is it possible to achieve hallucination-free LLM applications?Hallucination-free LLM applications are the Holy Grail or the One Piece of the LLM world. Over time, with a growing availability of resources, invested money, and brains researching the topic, it is hard not to be optimistic.Ilya Sutskever, one of the researchers behind GPT, is quite sure that hallucinations can be solved with better alignment alone. LLM-based applications are becoming more sophisticated and complex. The combination of the previously commented hallucination prevention strategies is conquering milestones one after another. Despite that, whether the goal is achievable or not is just a hypothesis.Some, like Yann LeCunn, Chief AI Scientist at Meta, have stated that hallucination problems are specific to auto-regressive models, and we should move away from architectures that can reason and plan. Others, like Gary Marcus, argue strongly that transformer-based LLMs are completely unable to eliminate hallucinations. Instead, he bets on neurosymbolic AI. But the good news is that even those not optimistic about mitigating hallucinations in today’s LLMs are optimistic about the broader goal.On average, experts’ opinions point either to moderate optimism or uncertainty. After all, my intuition is that there is enough evidence to believe that hallucination-free LLM applications are possible. But remember, when it comes to state-of-the-art research, intuitions must always be built on top of solid knowledge and previous research.Where does this leave us?Hallucinations are a blessing and a curse at the same time.

The key idea is to feed a harmful instruction into the system by hiding it within a website’s code.Consider a scenario where your program crawls websites and feeds the raw HTML to an LLM on a daily basis. The rendered page looks normal to you, with no obvious signs of anything wrong. Yet, an attacker can hide a malicious key phrase by matching its color to the background or adding it in parts of the HTML code that are not rendered, such as a style Tag.While invisible to human eyes, the LLM will')]"
