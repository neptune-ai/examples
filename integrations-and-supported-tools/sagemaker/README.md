# Using Neptune client with Amazon SageMaker

The following examples show how to use the Neptune client with SageMaker. The examples use Jupyter notebooks. The
notebooks in most cases should be run from either SageMaker notebooks or SageMaker Studio notebooks --
you'll find this information within the notebook itself.

For running the example of using the custom docker container, you will additionally need to install [docker] and
[AWS CLI] tools.
