# Back up run metadata from Neptune

You can use this script to download run metadata from Neptune to your system. Note that this script is currently in beta, and we welcome your feedback and contributions to help improve it.

## Prerequisites

Before using this script, make sure you have
1. the Neptune environment variables set up. For instructions, see the [documentation](https://docs.neptune.ai/setup/setting_credentials/).
2. `tqdm` installed using `pip install -U tqdm`

## Instructions

The script will generate run logs in the same folder as `bulk_download_metadata.py`. You can modify this location in the `logging.basicConfig()` function.

To use the script, follow these steps:

1. Run `bulk_download_metadata.py`.
1. Enter the download path where you want the metadata to be downloaded.
1. Indicate if you want remotely tracked artifacts to be downloaded.
1. All projects you have access to are displayed in the console. Enter the projects you want to download the run metadata from.

    Example: `ml-team/classification,ml-team/image-segmentation`

## Download File types
The filetype of the downloaded metadata will depend on the Neptue field type to which it was logged.

Single values like parameters, `sys` and `monitoring` fields, etc. and `StringSet` like `sys/tags` will be logged to a `simple_metadata.json` file under their respective `RUN_ID` folders. This JSON will have the flattened namespaces of the metadata as the keys.

| Neptune field fype | Downloaded file type
|:---:|:---:
|[Artifact](https://docs.neptune.ai/api/field_types/#artifact) / [File](https://docs.neptune.ai/api/field_types/#file) / [FileSeries](https://docs.neptune.ai/api/field_types/#fileseries)| Same as original
| [FloatSeries](https://docs.neptune.ai/api/field_types/#floatseries) / [StringSeries](https://docs.neptune.ai/api/field_types/#stringseries) | CSV
| [FileSet](https://docs.neptune.ai/api/field_types/#fileset) | ZIP
| Everything else | `simple_metadata.json` |

## Download directory structure

All downloadable objects will follow the below folder structure inside the download directory:  
`WORKSPACE_NAME/PROJECT_NAME/RUN_ID/PATH/INSIDE/THE/RUN`


Example structure:
```
DOWNLOAD_FOLDER
├── WORKSPACE_1_FOLDER
│   ├── PROJECT_1_FOLDER
│   │   ├── RUN-1
│   │   │   ├── simple_metadata.json

├── WORKSPACE_2_FOLDER

```

## Note

There are a few things to keep in mind when using this script:

- Currently, only run metadata is downloaded. Project and model metadata are not downloaded†.
- All runs from the selected project will be downloaded. It is not currently possible to filter runs†.
- To download remotely tracked artifacts, the system you are running the script from must have access to the remote artifact location. Downloading remote artifacts can considerably increase execution times depending on the artifact sizes.

† Support for these can be added based on feedback
