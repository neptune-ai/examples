# Migrating from W&B to Neptune

This script allows you to copy run metadata from W&B to Neptune.

## Prerequisites
- A Weights and Biases account, `wandb` library installed, and environment variables set.
- A neptune.ai account, `neptune` python library installed, and environment variables set. Read the [docs](https://docs.neptune.ai/setup/installation/) to learn how to set up your installation.

## Instructions

To use the script, follow these steps:

1. Run `wandb_to_neptune.py`.
1. Enter the source W&B entity name. Leave blank to use your default entity.
1. Enter the destination Neptune workspace name. Leave blank to read from the `NEPTUNE_PROJECT` environment variable.
1. Enter the number of workers to use to copy the metadata. Leave blank to let `ThreadPoolExecutor` decide.
1. Enter the W&B projects you want to export as comma-separated values. Leave blank to export all projects.
1. The script will generate run logs in the working directory. You can change the directory with `logging.basicConfig()`. Live progress bars will also be rendered in the console.
1. Private Neptune projects corresponding to the W&B projects will be created if they don't exist. The project description will be set as *Exported from <W&B project URL>*. You can change the description later.

## Metadata mapping from W&B to Neptune

| Metadata | W&B | Neptune |
| :-: | :-: | :-: |
| Project name | example_project | example-project<sup>1</sup> |
| Project URL | project.url | project.wandb_url |
| Run name | run.name | run.sys.name |
| Run ID | run.id | run.sys.custom_run_id<sup>2</sup> |
| Notes | run.notes | run.sys.description |
| Tags | run.tags | run.sys.tags |
| Group | run.group | run.sys.group_tags |
| Config | run.config | run.config<sup>3</sup> |
| Run summary | run.summary | run.summary<sup>3</sup> |
| Run metrics | run.scan_history() | run.<METRIC_NAME><sup>4</sup> |
| System metrics | run.history(stream="system") | run.monitoring.<METRIC_NAME><sup>5</sup> |
| System logs | output.log | run.monitoring.stdout |
| Source code | code/* | run.source_code.files |
| requirements.txt | requirements.txt | run.source_code.requirements |
| Model checkpoints | \*.ckpt/\*checkpoint\* | run.checkpoints |
| Other files | run.files() | run.files |
| All W&B attributes | run.* | run.wandb.* |

<sup>1</sup> Underscores `_` in a W&B project name are replaced by a hyphen `-` in Neptune  
<sup>2</sup> Passing the wandb.run.id as neptune.run.custom_run_id ensures that duplicate Neptune runs are not created for the same W&B run even if the script is run multiple times  
<sup>3</sup> Values are converted to a string in Neptune  
<sup>4</sup> `_steps` and `_timestamps` associated with a metric are logged as `step` and `timestamp` respectively with a Neptune metric  
<sup>5</sup> `system.` prefix is removed when logging to Neptune

## What is not exported
- Models
- W&B specific objects and data types
- `run.summary` keys starting with `_`†
- Metrics and W&B attributes starting with `_`†
- Files with path starting with any of `artifact/`, `config.yaml`, `media/`, `wandb-`†

† These have been excluded at the code level to prevent redundancy and noise, but can be included.

## Post-migration
* W&B Workspace views can be recreated using Neptune's [overlaid charts](https://docs.neptune.ai/app/charts/) and [reports](https://docs.neptune.ai/app/reports/)
* W&B Runs table views can be recreated using Neptune's [custom views](https://docs.neptune.ai/app/experiments/#custom-views)
  ![Example W&B Runs table view recreated in Neptune](https://neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/wandb_table.png)
* W&B Run Overview can be recreated using Neptune's [custom dashboards](https://docs.neptune.ai/app/custom_dashboard/)

## Performance benchmarks

The script was tested by copying 32 W&B runs across 8 projects, totaling ~1MB spread across metrics and files.  
On an internet connection with download and upload speeds of 340Mbps and 110Mbps, respectively, and an average round-trip time of 18ms and 19ms respectively to Neptune and W&B servers, the entire process took ~30 seconds using 20 workers.

Neptune client version 1.10.4 and wandb client version 0.17.4 were used.
